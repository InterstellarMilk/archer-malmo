		<h1>First Impressions</h1>
		<p>Upon entering the building I was a little confused since we entered a cotton museum. It wasnt untill we went in an elevator to the above floors that I realized the offices were above us.The office was very neat, it smelled like coffee and seemed like a pretty lax work enviornment.There was a ping-pong table to the side right as we entered and of course there were people already taking advantage of that. Suprisingly, they also had a bike rack for those who Like biking to work</p>

		<h1>The Presentation</h1>
		<p>Overall the presentation was pretty straight forward. It was about what I expected. The employee giving us the presentation was very knowledgable. I could tell he had been doing that job for a long time. He took the time to go into carefull detail on parts of his job. Even gave some humor every now and again</p>

		<h1>The Tour</h1>
		<p>During the tour we went through a series of small narrow hallways to get to their lobby. The lobby was a small neat space. Intrestingly they has a ladder decorated with Christmas lights instead of a tree</p>

		<h1>Favorite Part</h1>
		<p>I would say that my favorite part of the experience was going down to the room with the green screen and the infinity wall. It was very interesting listening to what kidn of projects they do in their such as VR.They even shared specific details such as what kind of editing software they use.</p>

		<h1>Other Thoughts</h1>
		<p>Overall I thought the exerience was good. I do think the presentation could have been a little more enteractive. Questions were answered with 10 minute long answeres rather a quicker more summed up responce.I beielve tht have too long of a presentation can be harmful for the experience, because like web design, less is more. Going in detail is great, but spening an hour on one topic gets a little stale. Having a look into the offices would be a neat cherry on top to see. I do like the fact that we could see the broadcast room. Taking time to see things like that give the whole experience an added. We went ot cook out afterwards and it was good.   </p>
